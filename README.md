Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The purpose of this analysis was to break down the ride sharing data by city type and then to break it down further by the weekly fares by city type. In order to achieve this we looked at the total number of driver, rides and the total fares by each city . Once we had that data we can then format it and create a line graph illustrating throughout the year the total fare by city type.


Results

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

By loooking at the image above we can see that urban areas have more drivers compared to a rural area.

This image is showing the average fare compared to the amount of riders and drivers. Which oddly enough seems to even out when it comes to the average fare per driver/rider.

Then we began to look at the average fare within a specific time frame, January-April. The image below was the output of data showing us and allowing us to compare the average fare between rural, urban and suburban areas. Since this is alot of raw numberical data it can be straining on the eyes so in order to make it more pleasing we placed the data into a line graph so we can see the flow and bettern point out the ups and downs of the prices throughout the year.

Summary: 
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1. Marketing - If the CEO wants more buisness in the rural area he/she needs to drive up the market for not only drivers but riders as well. By doing this you can offer incentives to drivers for signing up as well as perks or points to riders once they hit a certain number of rides. 
2. Numbers also seem to be diving down in the beginning of the years and look to be ramping back up around spring. This could be that most people stay home and inside during colder months. In this case a partnership with bars/hotels or venues would help both parties drive up business during the slow months. For instance enjoy a drink and ride at 25% off during such and such times. When people want to stay in it usually takes a bit more to get them out so partnering with and "outing" atompshere or venue will help make the need for a rideshare more appealing.
3. Lastly I would have the CEO really dig into the urban market . Since that is where most of the business and profits are coming from as a company you need to make sure your customers and employees (drivers) are getting all of their needs meet and you are hearing their complaints or suggestions.
